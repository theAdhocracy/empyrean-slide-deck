# Accessibility

Most is provided by default, but you should provide an accessible name.

Implicitly has the ARIA role `dialog`.

If being used as an alert (requires user confirmation or response) then should have `role="alertdialog"` set.

Focus needs to be considered, but should be largely covered.
